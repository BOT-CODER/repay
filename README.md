# How it Works? 
 It Generates a reverse Shell code for your victim in all Programming language

## What is Reverse Shell code?
  <p>Reverse TCP shells are similar to bind shells, in that they allow shell access over a network. The key difference is that a bind shell will listen on the remote host, but a remote shell instead instructs the remote host to connect back to another.
Using a reverse shell is of particular use if a target has a firewall that blocks incoming connections, but does not block outgoing connections.</p>

The Code is written in python3 so Dont worry it works well without any Bug
